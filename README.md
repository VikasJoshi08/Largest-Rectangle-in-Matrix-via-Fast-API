# Largest-Rectangle-in-Matrix-via-Fast-API
The “Largest Rectangle in Matrix” problem involves finding the largest rectangle of identical numbers in a 2D matrix. This is typically solved using dynamic programming or stack-based algorithms.
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python .It’s easy to use and has automatic interactive API documentation.Postman is a popular API client used to send requests to an API and receive responses. It supports various types of requests like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. In the context of FastAPI, you can use Postman to send a POST request to your FastAPI server with a JSON body containing your matrix, and receive the response from the server.
In this scenario, you would run the FastAPI server, which hosts your “Largest Rectangle in Matrix” solution. Then, using Postman, you would send a POST request to the FastAPI server with your matrix. The server would process the matrix, find the largest rectangle, and send back the response, which you can view in Postman. This allows you to interact with your FastAPI application without building a frontend.
